# Automatic Slicing and Distribution of 3D Models Using Anamorphosis
The thesis is mainly about solving automated anamorphic puzzles using automatic slicing and distribution algorithms. However, the associated software, Anamorph Puzzle, allows the user to solve a model in any of the 3 model processing methods, or solving modes:
1. Manual Slicing and Distribution
2. Manual Slicing and Automatic Distribution, or Manual Slicing, Auto Distribution
3. Automatic or Auto Slicing and Distribution

## Test Models
The test models are the following 10 models available for solving in each of of the 3 solving modes. They are already provided inside the application. Thus, the user no longer needs to download the models.

## Applications of the Solving Modes
### Manual Slicing and Distribution
The models were both pre-sliced and pre-distributed in Blender before being imported to the application's Unity project.

### Manual Slicing and Automatic Distribution
The models were pre-sliced in Blender, but automatically distributed in the application using an algorithm.

### Automatic Slicing and Distribution
The models were both automatically sliced and distributed in the application with algorithms.
